        <h2 class="mb-5">Project Description</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">The GCIEL Viking Longship VR Experience project aims to revolutionize 
          educational approaches in the 21st century by leveraging virtual reality to create an 
          engaging and immersive learning environment. This experience allows users to actively 
          participate in constructing a Viking longship, enhancing their understanding of historical 
          craftsmanship and culture through interactive storytelling. Each component of the ship is 
          introduced with a unique poem and audio description, offering insights into its significance 
          before users proceed to place the piece as part of the overall assembly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The Viking Ship Assessment app supports this VR experience by providing 
          an in-depth analysis of player interactions. Designed to capture and visualize engagement, 
          the app focuses on critical aspects such as user position within the VR space, time 
          spent interacting with each ship piece, and the frequency the user views each component. By 
          transforming and displaying this data, the app enables researchers to identify which elements 
          of the VR experience successfully capture and maintain user attention, as well as areas where 
          adjustments might enhance the educational impact.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">A primary feature of the Viking Ship Assessment app is the "Piece View Amount" 
          animation, found above. This animation tracks how often each ship component is viewed 
          across users, highlighting potential drop-off points where interest might drop. This insight 
          allows for targeted adjustments to specific pieces that might require additional visual detail or 
          interactivity to retain student interest.</p>

        <img class="image" src="img/viewAmt.gif" alt="ViewAmount">

        <p class="paragraph">To further explore user engagement, the assessment app examines "Piece Completion 
          Time," capturing how long users spend on each component. This metric is crucial in identifying parts 
          of the experience that might be too complex or, conversely, too simple to hold attention. The experience
          gives the student the opportunity to view poems that include the name of each component and learn the 
          history behind them. As such this metric can help determine where learning may drop between pieces and 
          what may draw more attention.
        </p>

        <img class="image" src="img/location.gif" alt="Location Animation">

        <p class="paragraph">Another core aspect of the app's analysis is the "Location Animation," which visualizes 
          each playerâ€™s head position over time in relation to key interactable objects in the VR environment. 
          By mapping these positions, the app reveals spatial engagement patterns, showing which areas of the VR 
          environment attract the most attention and which might benefit from repositioning. This insight is critical 
          for optimizing the layout of the VR experience to ensure users are guided intuitively through the content.
          Ultimately, this project exemplifies the potential of VR as a powerful educational tool and highlights the 
          importance of data-driven design in crafting immersive learning experiences that resonate with a wide range 
          of users.
